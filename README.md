Final Year Project: Pneumatic Industrial Robot for Pick and Place Application

Overview
This project involves the design and development of a 3-axis pneumatic pick-and-place robot built for industrial automation applications. It was completed as part of our final year engineering project in collaboration with an industry partner.

Technologies Used
- Pneumatic Systems
- Delta PLC (DVP14SS2)
- 5/2 Directional Control Valves
- CAD Design (SolidWorks)
- Ladder Logic Programming (Delta WPLSoft)

My Role
- Designed the 3-axis base and integrated the 4th axis for linear motion.
- Implemented ladder logic for sequence control using Delta WPLSoft.
- Coordinated with team members and the industry mentor for real-time deployment.

Note
Due to the nature of the project being under industrial collaboration, the source code and internal technical documents cannot be publicly shared.
